INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create new python project in IDE of choice
2. Copy and paste ticketReader and ticketTester into separate .py files
3. Make sure appropriate libraries are installed (requests, json, and pytest are the most important)
4. Run code, UI is CLI

NOTES:
* ticketReader uses simple username/password authentication. ticketTester, however, reads in my information from my own environmental variables which will not work on my machine. when running the test code, you'll either have to create your own environment variables according to the names specified in the code (ZCC_SUBDOMAIN, ZCC_USER, etc.) or rewrite the variables to fit your Zendesk account credentials
